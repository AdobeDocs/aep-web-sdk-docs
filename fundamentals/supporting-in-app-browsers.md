## Supporting In-App Browsers

Within browsers embedded inside mobile applications, the SDK will behave exactly as it would within a regular browser; however, you should make sure the Visitor ID gets passed from the mobile application into the website through the URL. This process is outlined in the documentation for the [Experience SDK for Mobile](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mobile/ios/hybrid_app.html).
